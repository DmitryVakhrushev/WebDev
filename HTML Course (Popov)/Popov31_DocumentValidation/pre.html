    How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!

    If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
    you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
    enemy - "Time Wasting".

    What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
    applies even more to the online world, than in regular
    business.
    </pre>
    You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
    doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
    start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.

    And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
    become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
    simply to get more done - in less time.

    So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
    you do to avoid them?

    1. Retyping the same old thing time and time again.
    2. Failing to manage your email effectively.
    3. Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.
    4. Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.


    Retyping the same old thing time and time again.
    ------------------------------------------------

    This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
    retype the same old simple information.

    Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
    signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
    communicating words quickly.

    Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
    enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
    having to type the same thing twice.

    I use this utility http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot , but
    there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
    available.

    Failing to manage your email effectively.
    -----------------------------------------

    I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
    be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
    own installed on your computer.

    i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
    set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
    trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
    emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
    into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
    through them afterwards and pull back any that have
    been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.

    ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
    organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
    FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.


    Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.
    ------------------------------------------------

    As someone who owns the fastest growing internet marketing
    forum, I can tell you the truth.

    Forums can be incredible marketing resources, but they can
    also crucify huge amounts of your time by sucking you into
    discussions that you just don't need to have.

    So structure your time and include some forum reading and
    posting - but avoid spending wasted hours in protracted
    debates with people who are never going to buy from you
    anyway.

    Better still sign yourself up to a good weekly forum
    roundup and that way you can keep yourself up-to-date, but
    without checking in every minute of the day. My own 'How To'
    Forum is called TOP POSTS and you can receive it each
    Thursday by sending a blank email
    to mailto:topposts@howtocorp.par32.com


    Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.
    ---------------------------------------------------------

    It's so easy to sit down, decide you'll take a quick look at
    some website, only to enter a mini-time warp. Three hours
    later you look up and discover you've yet to do a thing.

    The internet has an uncanny capacity to "Waste Your Time"
    and you've got to be resolute in your desire to beat off
    the temptation to click all those enticing links.

    I avoid this problem by proactively thinking about what I
    plan to achieve each day... before I even sit down at my PC.

    Remember, by the time you've turned on your monitor... it's
    already too late!

    To your online success!
