    <p>If you're involved <span>in an internet marketing business</span>, then
        you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
        enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

    <div>
        <p align="center">What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". <strong>And this
                applies even more to the online world</strong>, than in regular
            business.</p>

        <p>You see, <b>anyone can become</b> an online entrepreneur. It
            doesn't <i>involve start-up capital</i> or expensive equipment to
            start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

        <p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
            become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
            simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

        <p><em>what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
                you do to avoid them?</em></p>

    </div>

    <ol start="0">
        <li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
        <li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
        <li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
        <li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
    </ol>
