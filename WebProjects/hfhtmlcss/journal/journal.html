          Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
          through some interesting places on the way: 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Walla Walla, WA</li> 
          <li>Magic City, ID</li>
          <li>Bountiful, UT</li> 
          <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
          <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
          <li>Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>

          I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
          road today:
        </p>
            <blockquote>
                "Passing cars,<br> 
                When you can't see,<br> 
                May get you,<br> 
                A glimpse,<br> 
                Of eternity".<br>
            </blockquote>
        <p>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars.
        </p>

          My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
          everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
          I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>and a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
          thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
